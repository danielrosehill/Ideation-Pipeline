The the sort Markdown document in the holding bay contain my notes on repositories and projects. They should be organized into the sorted folder, reviewed lightly for typos, given that they were recorded using speech-to-text, and organized into the document. The repository replaced with a badge and a link, and the repository or project name follow the existing structure. When you finish processing all of them, you can empty out the document but don't delete it.
