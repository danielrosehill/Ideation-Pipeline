Does it exist, or has it already been created? 

Analyze whether the idea the user is considering implementing already exists.

If the idea already exists, assume the user prefers to use existing technology as long as it's within a reasonable budget for an individual user.

If the idea does not exist, or there is no close implementation of it, conclude that the idea does not exist, and identify this as a gap the user can pursue.
