# To Develop

Cherry-picked repositories that show merit and are worth continuing to work on and focus development efforts.

## Claude Code Writing Squad

I've been finding a lot of use for using Claude for various writing tasks within certain bounds, and would like to continue with this approach and explore adapting networks for long-form content, namely books.

## Claude Decision Evaluation Framework

Of the many AI experiments I've been trying out lately, this one, I think, was interesting and merits more exploration.

## Claude Deep Research Template

I might want to do some thinking as to how MCP tooling could be integrated more precisely into this template to support its ongoing use for forking and jump-starting research projects defined in a repository.

## Claude File Organiser Super Slash

This slash command and variants have been extremely helpful for organizing local file systems. I think that coupled with MCP, it could also be very useful in organizing remotes in a more systematic way than the Gemini feature is being natively integrated to.

## Claude Linux Desktop Manager

Using Claude to manage the Linux desktop has been a resounding success so far. My longer-term idea with this was to develop from a plugin and CLI-centric utility into a proper GUI with commands and an interface, and I think this would be worth doing at some point.

## Claude Media Monitor

This idea and concept in workspace could be very effectively bundled with MCP for client engagement and reporting.

## Cloud ASR MCP

Audio multimodal, in my opinion, will supplant the ASR + LLM transcription stack in fairly short order. The initial idea for this remote MCP was using traditional ASR tools before I updated it to use multimodal via the cloud.

I have validated that cloud transcription via multimodal audio models (Gemini) is both extremely effective and extremely affordable (current metrics: 302 transcriptions, 34K words, ~$1 in API cost!)

This was due to the fact that multimodal models are particularly challenging to use locally for the particular use case of long-form audio transcription, given that it poses significant challenges to attention span and chunking. So, for the moment, this is a cloud MCP, but I've also tried a local approach. Hopefully, at some point in the near future, this will become much more feasible in both implementations.

## Code Tutor Agent Model

This should probably be bucketed into my long-term ideas. It's less of an immediate idea that I have to execute and more of an idea that I'm keeping in the back of my mind as code generation and agentic tools become progressively more powerful and capable. Specifically, how can we go from a task-focused approach (for using code-gen models) to one that somehow combines executing and learning? This could be described as learning on the job from a flawed robot that you're supervising but sometimes learning from! Which is a very strange but potentially intriguing paradox for education!

## Context Waterfall Architecture Notes

This concept probably didn't require such a lengthy explanation, but it's still relevant to the type of context workflows that I'm working on developing. So the concept remains relevant.

## End Of Day Worklog

From a daily workflow standpoint, this is one of the ideas that I really wanted to develop and still want to. It could be implemented in a variety of different ways, ranging from an agent workflow to an identity pipeline, and I will definitely implement this as a wellness best practice in the near future.

## Gemini Transcription MCP

This is an audio multimodal transcription proof of concept that I expanded out into the Cloud ASR one with multiple backends. I actually might be errors in a single provider model, although I found that OpenRouter actually provides faster inference for Gemini models than Google ironically. If anything, an OpenRouter only implementation would make more sense!

## Home Inventory AI Assistants

These system prompts could be very useful for implementing in the revised inbox implementation I've created, which actually uses AI directly.
