# Experiments in Progress

Enduring experiments and proof-of-concepts that aren't going to be overnight projects. These are ongoing explorations to see if particular approaches or ideas work in practice.

## LLM Detective

This one could be added to a category of intriguing AI experiments intended to probe the potential, strange effects of simulated intelligence when they meet us.

## LLM Max Token Length 0225

This would actually be worth running again, as it's one of the parameters in AI models that continues to get extremely little attention but which I think is extremely important in practice.
