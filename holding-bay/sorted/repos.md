## Emissions Data Reports

This was a client project.

There are substantial professional initiatives working, gathering exactly this type of information. It remains useful as a small selection of these for potential ingress or playing around with content for AI analysis and could be expanded almost infinitely, given the vast amounts of these in the public domain. The challenge remains in aggregating them for analysis but may not be relevant in the future.

## End Of Day Worklog

From a daily workflow standpoint, this is one of the ideas that I really wanted to develop and still want to. It could be implemented in a variety of different ways, ranging from an agent workflow to an identity pipeline, and I will definitely implement this as a wellness best practice in the near future.

## Experiments And Evaluations Index

I want to keep organizing this as I do similar projects of this nature.

## Gemini Transcription MCP

This is an audio multimodal transcription proof of concept that I expanded out into the Cloud ASR one with multiple backends. I actually might be errors in a single provider model, although I found that OpenRouter actually provides faster inference for Gemini models than Google ironically. If anything, an OpenRouter only implementation would make more sense!

## Geopolitical Analysis System Prompts

This is a particularly useful prompt library to have on hand for use in ongoing and ideas experiments and should be developed and maintained.

## Github Gist MCP Minimal

This has actually been one of the most helpful MCP projects that I've undertaken so far. It was forked from the original project and focused on tool consolidation. That's less relevant to an extent, but this MCP has functioned extremely reliably and therefore should be maintained.

## Github Star Organiser

I haven't thought yet how this could best be implemented, but would very much like to work on this to bring it into a functional system using agentic AI and summarization.

The initial validation of pulling in an organized structure of repositories from GitHub was successful, so it's just pending thinking as to how it can be put into utility.

## Gmail Search Strings

This is one of the little utilities that has actually proven extremely helpful, and which I continue to find useful despite the advent of AI and other things.

## Google Air Quality MCP

I want to explore whether a better air quality API than CPI has arisen. It might also be prudent to use Waqi instead as a data source or offer them both. A unified provider might actually provide some fallback, and this could potentially be very useful. Although I've yet to submit exactly what the specifics are.

## Green Invoice API My Notes

It would be extremely useful to have a viable MCP for Green Invoice, and it's certainly feasible. It might be extremely helpful for expense filing and business management operations, so another one to keep on the list.

## Hebrew Date KDE Widget

One of the small utilities I'm very glad to have created, and would like to maintain as perhaps some additional bells and whistles could be added.
