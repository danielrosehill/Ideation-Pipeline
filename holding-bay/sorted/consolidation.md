## Github Star Organiser + Interesting Tech Things

The Github Star Organiser aims to sort through GitHub star lists, while Interesting Tech Things could serve as a downstream data source for this list.

**Github Star Organiser:**

I haven't thought yet how this could best be implemented, but would very much like to work on this to bring it into a functional system using agentic AI and summarization.

The initial validation of pulling in an organized structure of repositories from GitHub was successful, so it's just pending thinking as to how it can be put into utility.

## AI Agent UN + Israel GeoInsights + Middle Eastern Peace Summit

These projects pair closely together in the concept of agents for geopolitical decision modeling and AI-driven geopolitical analysis.

**AI Agent UN:**

**Israel GeoInsights:**

This pairs very closely with the Middle Eastern Peace Summit and AI, and AI general experiments in the concept of agents for geopolitical decision modeling.

## Claude Linux Desktop Manager + Llama OS Doctor

This idea can be consolidated into various explorations of how an agentic AI system can be used for system administration, especially in the context of proactive maintenance and post-boot diagnostics. For that purpose, these explorations use Claude and Llama to explore the same angle.

**Claude Linux Desktop Manager:**

Using Claude to manage the Linux desktop has been a resounding success so far. My longer-term idea with this was to develop from a plugin and CLI-centric utility into a proper GUI with commands and an interface, and I think this would be worth doing at some point.
