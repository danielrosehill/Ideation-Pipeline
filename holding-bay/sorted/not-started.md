# Not Started

Projects that are parked and waiting for time to work on them. Initial scope or context has typically been defined, but implementation hasn't begun yet.

## Batch Optical Archivist

Want to start for family photo backup!

## Claude Rescue

I haven't gotten around to starting or trying to actually implement this, but it would be extremely useful.

## Claude Stack Research Workspace

Given that I do some process like stack research or purchase evaluation almost daily across different contexts, this particular pattern and workspace is one that I want to continue developing and refining the template.

## Claude Therapy Tracker

This is one of the AI use cases that I feel most passionate about. Open sourcing and doing so well, beyond for my own personal use, I think that this template merits development and thinking.

## Claude Think Tank

This is one of my favorite spending ideas to explore.

I'm thinking about how this might fit alongside other models for similar processes like panels. I think the answer might be that a framework like this could provide a more ongoing exploration of the idea with the panel model being a good test case to try out in miniature before upgrading the experiment and model into a synthesized and ongoing think tank.

## Data Analysis Notebook

I've worked on quite a few data projects this year and wanted to have a first-entry notepad of sorts for gathering up small pieces of data with the idea of eventually creating a public data notebook of sorts. I haven't gotten around to doing that, but it remains something I aspire to do, and therefore, this is the holding project.

## Data Relationships Helper

This is one of my unstarted projects, but actually remains something that could be potentially very useful as I still commonly find myself trying to remember the different types of relationships in SQL databases. It would actually be a perfect utility for an AI assistant or agent, so should be kept for future use. If I identify any projects that are works in progress or holding but don't have anything in the readme, I should update them with a note to that effect.

## Deepgram Voice Keyboard Ubuntu

Deepgram's Voice Keyboard remains the best implementation I've seen for text entry in Linux, and their approach remains very instructive.

The API also has great utility and potential in the real-time voice typing application, which I sometimes think remains a separate domain than longer-form transcription.

## Dual WhatsApp Linux Desktop

This was a potentially very useful utility, as I still haven't found a WhatsApp client that specifically and only does two account support. It prevents the overhead of unwanted and unnecessary background processes. It could probably use a revision.
