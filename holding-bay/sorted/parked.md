## Crying Baby Audio Scrub

This was an interesting proof of concept and may have relevance in voice implementations.

## Emissions Data Reports

This was a client project.

There are substantial professional initiatives working, gathering exactly this type of information. It remains useful as a small selection of these for potential ingress or playing around with content for AI analysis and could be expanded almost infinitely, given the vast amounts of these in the public domain. The challenge remains in aggregating them for analysis but may not be relevant in the future.

## Homebox Ideas

I think that I've implemented most of these in my fork. If so, this can be moved to an archived repository.
