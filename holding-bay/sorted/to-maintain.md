# To Maintain

Repositories that are in good order and already started. These just need periodic maintenance to keep them up to date.

## AI Stack Oct 2025

Foundation in place and want to continue exploring topic.

## Claude ADHD Research Workspace

Tried this out and was entertaining. Want to keep exploring!

## Cool Claude Code Stuff

I created a bundle of Claude Code resources when Claude Code was beginning to emerge into the mainstream, and I don't think at the time I anticipated just how rapid the explosion of interest in the tool would be, justifiably.

I'd like to continue carefully gathering some of the most interesting projects, but it's now a very challenging undertaking, and there are other more dedicated and focused consolidators.

My main value is, I think strangely, in categorizing and taxonomizing which is most of the resources that I gather.

## Experiments And Evaluations Index

I want to keep organizing this as I do similar projects of this nature.

## Geopolitical Analysis System Prompts

This is a particularly useful prompt library to have on hand for use in ongoing and ideas experiments and should be developed and maintained.

## Github Gist MCP Minimal

This has actually been one of the most helpful MCP projects that I've undertaken so far. It was forked from the original project and focused on tool consolidation. That's less relevant to an extent, but this MCP has functioned extremely reliably and therefore should be maintained.

## Gmail Search Strings

This is one of the little utilities that has actually proven extremely helpful, and which I continue to find useful despite the advent of AI and other things.

## Hebrew Date KDE Widget

One of the small utilities I'm very glad to have created, and would like to maintain as perhaps some additional bells and whistles could be added.

## Israel To ROW Salary Converter V2

This is an extremely useful utility to have on hand and could be developed in different ways that might be more practical for use, like a Telegram bot. It essentially just requires very simple calculation, but it is a good reference utility.

## Jewish AI Projects

Expected this list will grow considerably. Interesting projects using MCPs for Jewish learning purposes in Torah should be maintained, even just periodically checking what's new and interesting and gathering the resources.

## Linux Friendly Voice Tech

This is very challenging to maintain, as it's becoming a vast field but nevertheless is very important and something I've already maintained in a few iterations.

## Linux MCP Clients

This will be a very dynamic field, I predict, and I want to keep this up to date. Currently, the tooling is dominated by CLIs that are challenging to use and set up. My hope is that as more user-friendly tools come to market, for Linux, I will keep this updated.
