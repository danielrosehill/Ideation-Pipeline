## Cool Claude Code Stuff

I created a bundle of Claude Code resources when Claude Code was beginning to emerge into the mainstream, and I don't think at the time I anticipated just how rapid the explosion of interest in the tool would be, justifiably.

I'd like to continue carefully gathering some of the most interesting projects, but it's now a very challenging undertaking, and there are other more dedicated and focused consolidators.

My main value is, I think strangely, in categorizing and taxonomizing which is most of the resources that I gather.
