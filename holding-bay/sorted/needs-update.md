## Google Air Quality MCP

I want to explore whether a better air quality API than CPI has arisen. It might also be prudent to use Waqi instead as a data source or offer them both. A unified provider might actually provide some fallback, and this could potentially be very useful. Although I've yet to submit exactly what the specifics are.

## Green Invoice API My Notes

It would be extremely useful to have a viable MCP for Green Invoice, and it's certainly feasible. It might be extremely helpful for expense filing and business management operations, so another one to keep on the list.

## Homebox Backup GUI

We may need to rewrite this a little bit to reflect updated data schema. Nevertheless, it remains a very useful and important backup utility to maintain.
