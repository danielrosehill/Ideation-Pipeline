# App Ideas (Staging / Pipeline Repository)

My motivation for creating this repository is to develop a better system for parking ideas for vibe coded apps (and utilities) that are pending execution/implementation.

Vibe-coding can be an immensely gratifying but oddly addictive pursuit. For the first time since the dawn of computing technology, it's possible to create utilities and proof of concepts at a pace that would not have otherwise been possible. 

Over the course of the past year - joined by Claude Code, Codex, and others - I've been working my way through a lengthy backlog of technology utilities that I always wished existed! In other cases I'm coming up with new ones. 

Either way: I tend to go through spurts of ideation. I've realized that nothing has to be created tomorrow. And that the process of letting ideas marinate is a sort of mental workflow of its own. 

## Process / Workflow

The process that I've developed for capturing these ideas has become relatively templated over time and consists of the following. If this maps onto any structured form of software development, then spec-driven development probably comes closest to an accurate descriptor:

- I record the idea as a voice note. The purpose of this workflow is to capture all the minute details that would be painstaking to write out at a keyboard. This voice note invariably becomes a mixture of a spec as well as some thoughts for the feasibility of creating this utility.  
- I transcribe this idea using ASR (Whisper etc) 
- I then use a large language model to clean up the transcript.  
- Finally, I use another pass of an LLM in order to get this cleaned up transcript and convert it into a polished script.   
- Finally, this becomes the bedrock for directing an agent to begin developing or vibe coding the implementation. 

The basic structure that will follow in this repository as it tries to aggregate these ideas is to group each discrete idea into its own folder.  Generate those foundational documents within that folder so that they're ready for development. 

Ideas would either lurk here indefinitely or be moved into a done folder if I get round to trying them out. 

If it works, I hope that this workflow will be useful.

Needless to say:

Anybody is welcome to take an idea whether implemented or not and try to implement it themselves. The ideas - like the code - are MIT!
