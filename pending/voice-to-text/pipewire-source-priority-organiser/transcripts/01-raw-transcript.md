Okay, so this will be one of the last voice recordings that I do in this year. Defining in context in voice format. While I'm finishing off these little bits and pieces that I really want to have in place that I'm tired of kind of. Usually it's stuff that I'm kind of tired of fighting around with the operating system and like finding these kind of scrappy hacks, which probably I wouldn't have even known how to do before the advent of AI tools. But it's nice to be able to actually create the solutions. Like, I'm very happy with my voice transcription app today. And that's a, that's a big thing I've been trying to create for a long time. So it's. That alone is an amazing, amazing help. So here's one more utility for voice centric workflows that I was. I don't think I haven't found it anywhere yet and I think it would be very helpful. So getting into voice tech and voice typing, I've been trying out different microphones to see basically how they work. And I like to kind of. There's a couple, there's a few that are, you know, very good and others that are kind of less good, but maybe better in certain contexts. Talking only about like three or four maybe, I don't know, five mic, five different, like a couple of headsets, a boundary mic for the desk, the headset I'm wearing now, etc. And I'm working on it at a desktop, desktop workstation, slash studio almost at this point with you know, speakers and USB hubs. And it's very easy to like accidentally have four or five microphones connected. That might sound a bit ridiculous, but you have. The webcam is a default. It has its own microphone. Not a good one. I never use it. I might have my Samson for doing. For when I want to do like quality voice recordings. The headset I have on now is a Logitech headset for transcription. And that's three already. And then maybe I might have just forgotten disconnect something and Bluetooth. I might have even a Bluetooth mic sync that I totally forgot is even being is connected. So it might seem strange, but it's actually credible that I found myself having five microphones connected to the computer or like three. And what I would like to do because I'm using these for transcription is to define something like a hierarchy or an order of precedence, which I've been kind of doing in pipewire. In was kind of service files and it's kind of very, it's very, it's not a really a very like intuitive or maintainable way to manage these configurations because they're defined in code. Each one for the microphone like it's, it's. You're not gonna, not easy just to swap around the order. So what I would like to do is have something like GUI for setting this priority order that will be persistent. So what I'm envisioning is kind of a rule based logic defining because you have the default microphone, the default source. And I think rather than having if I bind an application to a specific microphone, what I figured out is that it's actually much more sensible to bind an application to the default microphone and then use something like this to make that default microphone swap to the one that suits. You know, that makes sense in a given context, let's say. So the order of precedence actually might be based upon settings where I describe my activity. So for example, if I am recording voiceovers, I don't do that that much anymore. But back when I was doing YouTube videos that would, if I went into my voiceover mode that would flip the Samsung Q2U if it were available to the top of the order or if the atr, I don't need to give the specific examples. I have a, I have an xlr, I can't remember which, which exact microphone it is from from atr. So that would be one example of a rule. So we have a configuration voiceover mode or you know, doom voiceovers, whatever. And if I'm in that mode then shift those up to the top and it could be just as simple as like storing because the, like the amount of microphones that the operating system is going to see is still going to be pretty small. It's going to see a name, it's going to see a vendor id, it's going to see a manufacturer id. So they're going to be, you know, I'm only talking maybe I don't know, 10 microphones that the OS has ever seen. So I think it's something that when a new microphone is encountered, it could be held in a very, very lightweight data store. And then the user could, what I then think would make sense would be the user could give that a name because sometimes the vendors don't bother hard coding the actual model name into the thing and adding a. What I think would also be useful be a category. So like for dictation you might have gooseneck Lavelier, Bluetooth headset. That's the only complication I can think of is bluetooth sources, but stick with it for a second wired headset so that the logic in dictation mode could just be if you're in dictation mode and there is a studio microphone and there is a headset, headset gets priority. So that's basically what I'm envisioning at the very simple implementation. It could just be like this microphone is better than this microphone if there's a Logitech 390. But no, I think it's easier to do this at the either have one general configuration or profile based and maybe have those alternate options. But anyway, that's the general idea. And the logic is basically simply that this would have to be like a background process that runs on boot. It's running, it's got a GUI that you can maybe call up from the system tray. I think would probably be necessary for something like this. And it's the kind of thing that you might define your. It's the kind of tool that you might go into like once every month or so or once every few months to change out or to lower the precedence of a microphone. But it's not like a frequent access tool and it would just be running in the background. And then I'm not sure from an implementation standpoint with pipewire how it could handle that actual toggling of sources, but it would be doing that. It would be essentially a source manager. If this already exists. I'd be delighted to find out that someone's already made this. But what I've seen so far is kind of, I think the classic Goldilocks problem in software by which stuff is either very basic or insanely overcomplicated. And you know, I might find like a stage routing tool that has this as a feature. But then I have to like learn this like really complex software. Whereas I think what I want simply microphone source prioritization with the GUI is a fairly straightforward profile based, rule based logic essentially. So that's the idea.
